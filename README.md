# Projective-Transform-PHP-JS

This is a simple website that allows to upload photos from which pixel 
coordinates can be transformed to real world coordinates. The user needs 
to provide four pixel-real-world-coordinate pairs that are assumed to 
lie in a plane.

The projective transform is well deocumented here:
